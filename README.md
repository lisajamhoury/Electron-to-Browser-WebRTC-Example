# Electron to Browser Connection with WebRTC

This combines the [Electron Quick Start](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) with the [Realtime Communication with WebRTC](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web/#0) tutorial from Codelabs.

It runs a Socket.io signal server, then a peer connection over webRTC between Electron and the browser. Electron serves the signal server. This currently runs over localhost.
